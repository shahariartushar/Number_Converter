# Number_Converter
It's a simple program in assembly language. The main task of this project is to convert number one to another format. I use 3 types of number, such that Decimal, Hexadecimal and Binary. There is some bitwise operation to do all the work. This program can easily handle 16x bit of each number system.

To run this project you have follow some instructions, that are
* install microprocessor emulatator(emu 8086)
* open code/converter(final).asm in the emulator
* compile and run
